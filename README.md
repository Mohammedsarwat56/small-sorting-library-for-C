sortlib is small library which contain 14 sorting algorithm from basic ones (bubble sort , insertion sort....)  to advanced ones (TIM sort (not fully) , Quick sort ,merge sort)

  how to setup : 

              put the library file in your project
              include both declarations and IMPLEMENTATIONs in your source file :

              #define SORTLIB_IMPLEMENTATION        this necessary for IMPLEMENTATIONs  
              #include "sortlib.h"                  then inlcude the whole library 

              #define SORTLIB_IMPLEMENTATION must come before #include "sortlib.h" in your source file
